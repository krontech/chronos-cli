chronos-cli (0.3.1~beta69) unstable; urgency=medium

  * pipeline: Check color detect pin to determine mono vs. color sensor.
  * Fix boot order dependency on chronos-fpga package.
  * Add systemd service files to start cam-pipeline on boot.
  * pipeline: Add a check to ensure PAUSED->PLAYING completes.
  * pipeline: Combine live display and playback states.
  * Move automounter scripts into chronos-tools package.
  * More pipeline race conditions with display reconfiguration.
  * pipeline: Remove playback timer and minimize display reconfig events.
  * Work in progres: Replace Twisted DBus with Python-DBus
  * pychronos: Add mask parameter to regRead and regWrite helpers.
  * made methods with arguments also available through GET using the field names as variables
  * cam-pipeline: Make all D-Bus methods return the status dict.
  * Move display timing setup into cam-pipeline (livedisplay API change).
  * Twisted: Allow more cross-origin request for the wait APIs.
  * Fix bug in setDescription to allow setting an ID of zero.
  * DBus and Twisted: add description and cross-origin support.
  * added ability to set foreground and background colour on tap-to-exit-button
  * fixed issue in the touch thing. Made the text on screen adjustable with the GET "message" field.
  * Added waitForTouch and waitForTouchThenBlackcal to web api
  * Added playbackImage which displays an image from the save buffer. GET is implemented with the variable frameNum setting which frame to display.
  * Fixed recording bug. Fixed camera not starting due to bus error in init.
  * Fix sensor deadlock during gain calibration due to wavetable update.
  * Fixed some issues with the sensor using the new timing system. Also moved ioInterface into regmaps
  * Adjusted lux1310 to use the new timing engine
  * Added web interface added framerate control separate to limit pipeline rebuilds
  * Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/krontech/chronos-cli
  * Add arguments to camtest.py and implement white balance in camera.py
  * Remove blackref mode from pipeline, and clean up the playback thread.
  * Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/krontech/chronos-cli
  * Add spd.read() function to get JEDEC SPD data.
  * Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/krontech/chronos-cli
  * started working on recordings. Got whitebalance interface working
  * Fix bugs in resolution switching.
  * Added backup files from emacs to gitignore list
  * controlApi now detects if FPGA is running (via running testFpga.py and finding if it crashed or succeeded). also fleshed out configuration of resolution and framerate.
  * Added docstrings to most functions in ioInterface
  * Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/krontech/chronos-cli
  * Fixed bugs in ioInterface
  * Reorganization of python scripts into sensors and regmaps module.
  * moved io to ioInterface so namespace works better
  * Added some scripts for syncing a directory to the camera. Also the start of an API for the IO block and initial Twisted APIs
  * Add recording sequencer to the camtest.py demo.
  * Add zero-time black calibration to the python API.
  * Add black calibration routines to python camera class.
  * Fix race condition in generation of DBus segment signal.
  * Add python class for Camera initialization.
  * Add execute permissions when creating directories for DNG save.
  * Add python class for programming and calibration of the LUX1310 sensor.
  * pipeline: Enable pixel blending on /dev/fb0 when starting the pipeline.
  * Correct missing signal delivery due to missing return statements.
  * Make SIGHUP and SIGTERM async-safe by handling in the GMainLoop.
  * Add sequencer command class to aid in register programming.
  * Add additional blocks and documentation to pychronos.
  * Add lux1310 named registers, and frame readout helpers to python module.
  * Add Debian packaging of python3-pychronos module.
  * Add lux1310 class and more documentation to the Python/FPGA wrappers.
  * Add largefile support when saving H.264 files.
  * Add D-Bus "segment" signal for notification of new recorded video.
  * Ensure abs(frame delta) < length when in playback mode.
  * Convert mono TIFF to 8-bit gamma, and add "tiffraw" for 16-bit linear data.
  * Generate version from git tags.
  * Fix segfault if the playframe goes outside the recorded regions.
  * pipeline: Monochrome DNG files should use LinearRaw encoding.
  * Ignore recording segments in the calibration or display area.
  * Avoid stalling D-Bus during teardown by doing fsync from another thread.
  * Add Python/FPGA wrapper module.
  * Add missing DBus config file to chronos-video package.
  * Split Debian installation into multiple packages.
  * upower: Periodically write battery status to /var/run/bmsFifo
  * Upstream release v0.3.1-beta
